# Test

## How to use Docker + Run the Program as a Container:

1. Ensure Docker is properly installed onto your machine (Windows requires a restart)

2. Create the Image.

    Open the `test123` directory in your terminal, and run this command:
   
    `docker build -t test123 .`
   
        (Note: `-t test123` notates the name you give the image, you can choose to name it whatever you want.)
